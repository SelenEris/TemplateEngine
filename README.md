# TemplateEngine
Template Engine project in Pyhton, including Semantic Web

The aim is to create templates in python for graphic data (data written as a graph). Here, the main data are persons.
To each of them is associated a template fully editable by the "edit" page, with a language created from  which contains
Variables, Constants, Sequences, Loop and Tests.


To run the project :
- install Python on your computer : https://www.python.org/downloads/
- install the Flask API (lastest version) : pip install -U Flask
- launch the "main.py" file : py ./main.py
- open a web browser and go to the address given (usually it is http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Getting documentation :
- python -m pydoc path_of_the_file_from_source

From there, you can choose a person, go to their template and edit it, then going back and do the same for someone else.
